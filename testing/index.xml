      <description>PonyTest is Pony&#39;s unit testing framework. It is designed to be as simple as possible to use, both for the unit test writer and the user running the tests.
Each unit test is a class, with a single test function. By default, all tests run concurrently.
Each test run is provided with a helper object. This provides logging and assertion functions. By default log messages are only shown for tests that fail.</description>
